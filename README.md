Docker is a truly excellent bit of tech that allows us to specify the environment in which we want all of our applications to live within a simple `Dockerfile`. This effectively allows for easier collaboration and rids us of the "it works on my machine" problem that is soo prevalent in development teams across the globe.

As such, it would be a great idea on how to effectively containerize Go applications using the Docker containerization technology.

This repository handle on the following:

- The basics of Docker and how it is useful to us developers
- Writing a Simple Dockerfile for your Go applications
- Finally, how to deploy these applications easily to DigitalOcean
